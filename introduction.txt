I need to transfer a domain from Netlify to AWS.

How is this done and what challenges will be presented?

Step 1 Learn about Netlify and how to safely move domain back to hostinger
Step 2 Learn about Hostinger and how to safely move domain to AWS
Step 3 Renew Domain on AWS

I am worried but I will just do what I think will work and help trying other solutions. 
I have watched videos but none I found give we the whole solution. 

I will delete my domain from Netlify and Hope that help the Hostinger account get access back
