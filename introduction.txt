I need to transfer a domain from Netlify to AWS.

How is this done and what challenges will be presented?

Step 1 Learn about Netlify and how to safely move domain back to hostinger
Step 2 Learn about Hostinger and how to safely move domain to AWS
Step 3 Renew Domain on AWS

I am worried but I will just do what I think will work and help trying other solutions. 
I have watched videos but none I found give we the whole solution. 

I will delete my domain from Netlify and Hope that help the Hostinger account get access back

I deleted the Netlify hosting and no changes
I learned I have an expired TLS/Secure Socket License  so I am trying to fix it. 

The domain may not be hosted on Hostinger and I don't know about the Nameservers either.

I am using the support feature of Hostinger now....

The solution was that the domain was expired and owned by someone else. Part of me knew but did not want to believe it.
